# university-management-system

This is a simple University Management System built using C++, demonstrating the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling. The system allows users to add, search, and manage student records, including details like the student's name, roll number, semester, and subject.

//Technologies Used//
C++: The core programming language used to implement the project.
File Handling: To store and retrieve student data in a file (university.txt).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation and abstraction are used to manage student data.
Windows System Calls: Used for clearing the console (system("cls")) and adding delays (Sleep()).
